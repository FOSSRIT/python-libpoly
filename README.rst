python-libpoly
==============

Python bindings for the [`libPOLY`](http://github.com/traviswhitaker/libPOLY) computer music library.

`libPOLY` is not packaged with these bindings, which will expect to find `libpoly.so` installed in your system's
library search path.

Note that `libPOLY` and these bindings are under active development and are subject to frequent API changes.
See [`libPOLY`](http://github.com/traviswhitaker/libPOLY) for further documentation.
