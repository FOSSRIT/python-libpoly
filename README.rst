python-libpoly
==============

Python bindings for the ``libPOLY`` computer music library.

``libPOLY`` is not packaged with these bindings, which will expect to find ``libpoly.so`` installed in your system's
library search path.

Note that ``libPOLY`` and these bindings are under active development and are subject to frequent API changes.
See libPOLY_ for further documentation.
